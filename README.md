Exploratory data analysis project on a dataset which was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO). This is completed as part of my internship at Innomatics Research Labs. ðŸš€

Explored for relevant details and inconsistencies in the data before treating it for its null values, outliers, incorrect data types, and duplicates.

Looked into the statistics of important columns; mainly through univariate and bivariate analysis. Produced some interesting insights on numerical and categorical features.

Lastly, validated/answered two important research questions.

Cheers!
